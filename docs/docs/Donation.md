Hysteria is an open source project born out of a passion to bring value to the community - especially those living behind walls of censorship. If you share our belief in the cause and are willing to provide financial support, your contribution will play an important role in sustaining and growing this project.

Should you wish to be recognized for your support, we are more than happy to list your name or the name of your organization as an official Hysteria sponsor on our project page.
